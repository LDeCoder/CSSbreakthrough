Learning CSS tips and tricks for Final Project Breakthrough - LOVE THIS! SO FUN!

This was the original layout for Team Breakthrough that was to be used for our final project. Ahtough, we ran into a snag when we wanted to import this into React.js, and therefore we completely restyled the homepage, not realizing that we could have done some simple reworking and actually used this layout. Hello world! hah

However, take a look at the Team Breakthrough project, as our homepage and site layout ended up being really quite lovely!
